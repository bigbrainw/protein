# Project Title (Please Update)

A Python project likely focused on machine learning, data analysis, and potentially serving a model via a web application.

## Project Structure

The project contains a mix of Python scripts, data files, and a machine learning model. Key files include:

*   `main.py`: Likely the main entry point for the application or a primary script.
*   `app.py`: Suggests a web application component, possibly using a framework like Flask or FastAPI.
*   `get.py`, `haha.py`, `test.py`: Auxiliary Python scripts for various tasks (e.g., data fetching, utilities, testing).
*   `mlp_model.pt`: A PyTorch machine learning model file.
*   Data files:
    *   `converted_ddg.csv`
    *   `Lysosome.csv`
    *   `thermomut_ddg.csv`
    *   `labels.csv`
    *   `data.csv`
    *   `data.json`
    *   `entropy.npy`
*   `README.md`: This file.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `venv/`: Directory for Python virtual environment (recommended).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   A virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) is highly recommended.

You may also need to install specific Python libraries based on the project\'s `requirements.txt` (if available) or by inspecting the imports in the Python files. Common libraries for such projects include:
*   `torch` (for `mlp_model.pt`)
*   `pandas` (for handling `.csv` files)
*   `numpy` (for `entropy.npy` and numerical operations)
*   A web framework like `Flask` or `FastAPI` (if `app.py` is a web app)

### Installing

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    \`\`\`

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    \`\`\`bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    \`\`\`

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    If a `requirements.txt` file exists:
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \`\`\`
    Otherwise, you may need to install libraries manually, e.g.:
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install torch pandas numpy flask  # Example libraries
    \`\`\`

## Usage

Describe how to run the main application or scripts.

*   To run the main script (assuming `main.py`):
    \`\`\`bash
    python main.py
    \`\`\`
*   To run the web application (assuming `app.py` and Flask):
    \`\`\`bash
    flask run  # Or python app.py
    \`\`\`

(Please update these instructions based on your project\'s actual execution steps)

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. For example, if using `pytest`:
\`\`\`bash
pytest
\`\`\`
Or if `test.py` is the test runner:
\`\`\`bash
python test.py
\`\`\`

## Built With

*   **Python**: Core programming language.
*   **PyTorch**: (Likely, due to `mlp_model.pt`) For machine learning.
*   **Pandas**: (Likely) For data manipulation and analysis with CSV files.
*   **NumPy**: (Likely, due to `.npy` file and common use with ML/data) For numerical computing.
*   **Flask/FastAPI/Other**: (Potentially, due to `app.py`) Web framework.
